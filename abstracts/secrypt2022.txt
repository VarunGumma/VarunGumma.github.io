In recent years, Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) has become quite popular and effective for enforcing access control in dynamic and collaborative environments. Implementation of ABAC requires the creation of a set of attribute-based rules which cumulatively form a policy. Designing an ABAC policy ab initio demands a substantial amount of effort from the system administrator. Moreover, organizational changes may necessitate the inclusion of new rules in an already deployed policy. In such a case, re-mining the entire ABAC policy requires a considerable amount of time and administrative effort. Instead, it is better to incrementally augment the policy. In this paper, we propose PAMMELA, a Policy Administration Methodology using Machine Learning to assist system administrators in creating new ABAC policies as well as augmenting existing policies. PAMMELA can generate a new policy for an organization by learning the rules of a policy currently enforced in a similar organization. Fo r policy augmentation, new rules are inferred based on the knowledge gathered from the existing rules. A detailed experimental evaluation shows that the proposed approach is both efficient and effective.
